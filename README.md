# GA4 Notification Remover
Currently, when Google Analytics is called, a notice to migrate to GA4 is displayed. You can click away the hint, but it comes again. 
This extension hides the hint permanently.

The extension doesn't do much, it just sets the `ga-announcements` element to `display: none`.
